Why I main Chrom over Roy
</h1>
<body>

The reason that I main Chrom over Roy is the consistency and range that Chrom has over Roy. Roy is a <strong>stronger</strong> character when he hits his <strong>sweetspots</strong>, but that requires being <strong>extra close</strong> to the opponent to make sure they hit, which puts Roy at risk of being grabbed out of shield. Chrom however, can safely pressure from a <strong>distance</strong> using the <strong>whole length of his sword</strong> which is safer pressure on shield.
